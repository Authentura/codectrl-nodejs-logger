## What is CodeCTRL?

[CodeCTRL](https://github.com/Authentura/codectrl) is an application designed primarily
for the purpose of source code research and debugging. It allows developers and
researchers to gain an insight into the execution flow of a running application by
viewing a callstack at runtime by using the provided loggers for languages, without
interrupting your application.

## Installation

by issuing:

npm install @authentura/codectrl # etc...
```
